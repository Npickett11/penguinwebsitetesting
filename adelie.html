                <p>The Adélie Penguin (*Pygoscelis adeliae*) is one of the most iconic penguin species, recognized for its black-and-white plumage and distinctive white eye rings. Found along the entire Antarctic coast, these penguins are strong swimmers and skilled hunters, relying on krill, fish, and squid for their diet.</p>

                <p>Adélie Penguins are highly social and often seen in large colonies. During breeding season, they build nests out of small rocks and take turns incubating their eggs. These agile birds can travel long distances across ice and water to find food for their young.</p>
