                <p>The **Yellow-eyed Penguin** (*Megadyptes antipodes*) is a **rare and solitary** penguin native to **New Zealand**. Known for its **striking yellow eyes**, this penguin is one of the **rarest and most endangered** species of penguin in the world. Their distinct pale-yellow eye color and pale-grey plumage set them apart from other penguins.</p>

                <p>These penguins are **largely solitary**, with each pair maintaining a **territorial nesting site**. Unlike other penguins, they are **not as social** and prefer to nest in isolated areas of the forests and coastal regions. They primarily feed on **fish**, but the increasing human activity and predators threaten their habitat.</p>
