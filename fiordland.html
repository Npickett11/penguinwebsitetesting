                <p>The **Fiordland Penguin** (*Eudyptes pachyrhynchus*) is a **medium-sized crested penguin** native to the **Fiordland region** of the South Island of New Zealand. Known for its **bold yellow crest feathers**, the Fiordland Penguin is often seen as one of the **more elusive** penguin species, living in **dense temperate forests** near the coast.</p>

                <p>This penguin is notable for its **preference for forested nesting sites** as opposed to open beaches. Fiordland Penguins are also **great swimmers** and are highly **adaptable** to their environment, often diving for **krill, squid, and small fish**. However, they face threats from **habitat destruction**, **introduced predators**, and **human disturbance**.</p>
