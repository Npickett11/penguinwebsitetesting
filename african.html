                <p>The African Penguin (*Spheniscus demersus*) is the only penguin species found in **Africa**, and it primarily inhabits the **southern coast of South Africa and Namibia**. They are known for their **distinctive black and white plumage** and are often called **Jackass Penguins** because of their braying donkey-like call.</p>

                <p>These penguins are **adapted to warm coastal environments** and are one of the few species that thrive in hot climates. They can be found nesting on islands off the coast and are excellent swimmers, diving to catch small fish, squid, and crustaceans.</p>
