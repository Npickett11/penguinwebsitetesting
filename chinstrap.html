                <p>The Chinstrap Penguin (*Pygoscelis antarcticus*) is named for the thin black band under its chin, which makes it look like it's wearing a helmet strap. These penguins are known for their energetic and loud personalities, often engaging in playful and aggressive interactions within their colonies.</p>

                <p>Chinstrap Penguins inhabit rocky Antarctic islands and the surrounding sub-Antarctic regions. They are highly skilled swimmers and primarily feed on krill, small fish, and squid.</p>
